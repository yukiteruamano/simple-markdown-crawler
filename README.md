---------------------------------------------
A multithreaded üï∏Ô∏è web crawler that recursively crawls a website and creates a üîΩ markdown file for each page.
This project is a fork from markdown_crawler from Paul Pierre (abandoned for 2 years).

<br><br>

# üìù Overview
This is a multithreaded web crawler that crawls a website and creates markdown files for each page.
It was primarily created for large language model document parsing to simplify chunking and processing of large documents for RAG use cases.
Markdown by nature is human readable and maintains document structure while keeping a small footprint.
<br>

# ‚ú® Features include

> - üßµ Threading support for faster crawling
> - ‚èØÔ∏è Continue scraping where you left off
> - ‚è¨ Set the max depth of children you wish to crawl
> - üìÑ Support for tables, images, etc.
> - ‚úÖ Validates URLs, HTML, filepaths
> - ‚öôÔ∏è Configure list of valid base paths, base domains and exclude paths
> - üç≤ Uses BeautifulSoup to parse HTML
> - ü™µ Verbose logging option
> - üë©‚Äçüíª Ready-to-go CLI interface
<br>

# üèóÔ∏è Use cases
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - my primary usecase, use this to normalize large documents and chunk by header, pargraph or sentence
- LLM fine-tuning - Create a large corpus of markdown files as a first step and leverage `gpt-4o` or `mistral-small` to extract Q&A pairs
- Agent knowledge - Leverage this with [autogen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) for expert agents, for example if you wish to reconstruct the knowledge corpus of a videogame or movie, use this to generate the given expert corpus
- Agent / LLM tools - Use this for online RAG learning so your chatbot continues to learn. Use SERP and scrape + index top N results w/ markdown-crawler
- Knowledge database for OpenWebUI and others toosl for LLM Chats.
- And many more ..

<br><br>

# üöÄ Get started

If you wish to simply use it in the CLI, you can run the following command:

Install the package
```
pip install simple-markdown-crawler
```

Execute the CLI
```
simple-markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith
```

To run from the github repo, once you have it checked out:
```
pip install .
simple-markdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith
```

Or use the library in your own code:
```
from simple_markdown_crawler import md_crawl
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morty_Smith'
md_crawl(url, max_depth=3, num_threads=5, base_path='markdown')
```
<br><br>

# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- BeautifulSoup4
- requests
- markdownify

<br><br>
# üîç Usage

The following arguments are supported
```
usage: simple-markdown-crawler [-h] [--max-depth MAX_DEPTH] [--num-threads NUM_THREADS] [--base-path BASE_PATH] [--debug DEBUG]
                  [--target-content TARGET_CONTENT] [--target-links TARGET_LINKS] [--valid-paths VALID_PATHS] [--exclude-paths EXCLUDE_PATHS]
                  [--domain-match DOMAIN_MATCH] [--base-path-match BASE_PATH_MATCH]
                  [--links ]
                  base-url
```

<br><br>

# üìù Example
Take a look at [example.py](https://github.com/yukiteruamano/simple-markdown-crawler/blob/main/example.py) for an example
implementation of the library. In this configuration we set:
- `max_depth` to 3. We will crawl the base URL and 3 levels of children
- `num_threads` to 5. We will use 5 parallel(ish) threads to crawl the website
- `base_dir` to `markdown`. We will save the markdown files in the `markdown` directory
- `valid_paths` an array of valid relative URL paths. We will only crawl pages that are in this list and base path
- `exclude_paths` an array of exclude relative URL paths.
- `target_content` to `div#content`. We will only crawl pages that have this HTML element using CSS target selectors. You can provide multiple and it will concatenate the results
- `is_domain_match` to `False`. We will only crawl pages that are in the same domain as the base URL
- `is_base_path_match` to `False`. We will include all URLs in the same domain, even if they don't begin with the base url
- `is_debug` to True. We will print out verbose logging
<br><br>

And when we run it we can view the progress
<br>
> ![cli](https://github.com/yukiteruamano/simple-markdown-crawler/blob/main/img/ss_crawler.png?raw=true)

We can see the progress of our files in the `markdown` directory locally
> ![md](https://github.com/yukiteruamano/simple-markdown-crawler/blob/main/img/ss_dir.png?raw=true)

And we can see the contents of the HTML converted to markdown
> ![md](https://github.com/yukiteruamano/simple-markdown-crawler/blob/main/img/ss_markdown.png?raw=true)
